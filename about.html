          <div class="half-width">
            <p>Hello world! My name is Sarah. I'm a fullstack web
              developer. I have been learning lots of great digital skills from fantastic
              websites such as Skillcrush, FreeCodeCamp, and Code School. Over the past
              few months, I have used programming languages such as Ruby and JavaScript to
              build various projects and challenges. Today I am adding more projects to my
              portfolio as I look for my first clients.</p>

        <div class="full-width">
          <p>Besides creating websites and apps, I have
            extensive experience in education and teaching. I graduated from Otterbein
            College in 2008 with a Bachelors of Science degree. I attend the University
            of Akron to work on my masters and received a Masters of Science degree in
            2010. I have designed curriculum consistent with the Ohio Academic Content
            Standards and modified lessons according to individual learning needs for every
            student.</p>

          <p>I have taught students of all ages reading, math, and writing skills.
            I have experience mentoring studnets on study skills and test prep. When I
            worked at Sylvan Learning Center, I coached high school students on ACT and
            SAT, English, Reading, and Writing.</p>

          <p>When I am not coding, I write and manage weekly
            content for my blog BritishPandaChick. I also am working on opening
            my first craft shop. The BritishPandaChick craft shop will feature
            embroidery, felt applique, origami, cross stitch, beaded ornaments,
            and much more. I also enjoy working out, reading, cooking, and watching
            Disney movies.</p>
